This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to Jekyll. Weâ€™ll cover topics such as getting your site up and running, creating and managing your content, customizing the way your site works and looks, deploying to various environments, and give you some advice on participating in the future development of Jekyll itself.

## What is Cryogen?

Cryogen is a simple static site generator built with Clojure. It reads through a directory containing your Markdown content, compiles it into HTML and injects the content into your templates with the [Selmer](https://github.com/yogthos/selmer). It then spits out a ready-to-publish website complete with a sitemap and RSS feed.
 
If you come across anything along the way that this guide doesn't cover, please [file an issue](https://github.com/lacarmen/cryogen/issues/new) on the Github page and further instructions can be included here.
