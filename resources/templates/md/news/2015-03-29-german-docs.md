{:title "German Docs now Available"
 :layout :post}
 
I've decided to include a news page on this site so it's easier to see what changes I've been making to Cryogen. Sometimes it's a little difficult to tell what's been happening just by looking at the GitHub repos.

So with that, I'm happy to announce that Cryogen now has documentation in German! Translations were provided by Ben and you can find the German version of the site [here](http://cryogenweb.org/de).

As usual, if you find an error in the documentation or would like to see something that this guide doesn't cover, please [open an issue](https://github.com/cryogen-project/cryogen/issues/new) on the GitHub page.
 
If you'd be interested in helping with translations for future documentation please contact me as well.
